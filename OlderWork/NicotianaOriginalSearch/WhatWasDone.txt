Look for example with reticulation and trait data
Found example in Nicotiana, using tree of Chase et al.
Chase et al data NOT on treebase, but raw seqs are on genbank
Downloaded the ITS seqs, use mafft for alignment, using -auto option
In Mesquite, inspected alignment, trimmed ends that had seqs for only a small subset of taxa
Also truncated names and removed two redundant sequences
In paup, did parsimony tree search, took best trees, rooted, then set to likelihood gtr+gamma with clock, filtered for best under this model, did quick tree search to resolve branches, saved treefile (ChaseClockResolved.tre)
Opened treefile in R, took first tree (all equal likelihood due to identical seqs), rescaled based on 15.3 MY stem group age for Nicotiana from Clarkson et al. 2005, renamed based on iplant TNRS
Used pdftotext from xpdf with -layout option to convert empirical table 2 from pdf to text, then hand edited in Excel, saved as csv
Loaded table into R, used Mannitol seedling growth data.
Used iPlant TNRS on the trait taxon names
used treedata() in geiger to get overlapping set of taxa from tree and traits, saved as Nicotiana.phy and Nicotiana.csv
Got list of hybrids and parents from info in Chase et al.: HybridsFromChase.xlsx
Tony handcrafted enewick tree from this and the saved Nicotiana.phy
